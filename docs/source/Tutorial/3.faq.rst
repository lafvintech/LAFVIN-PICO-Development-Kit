===========================

Frequently Asked Questions

Hardware Issues
---------------------------

**Q: Why is the screen not displaying anything?**

A: Please check the following:

* Ensure the Pico is correctly inserted into the baseboard
* Check USB power supply
* Verify that the firmware has been flashed successfully
* Try reflashing the firmware

Performance Issues
---------------------------

**Q: Why is dragging the color wheel on the screen so slow?**

A: Because the Pico's memory is only 264KB, and the graphic interface may consume significant memory to display graphic widgets. The LVGL library with complex UI elements can be memory-intensive, which affects rendering performance.

**Q: How can I improve UI performance?**

A: Try the following:

* Reduce the number of widgets on the screen
* Simplify graphics and animations
* Optimize the LVGL configuration in ``lv_conf.h``
* Use optimized build settings (``-DPICO_OPTIMIZED_DEBUG=1``)

Software Issues
---------------------------

**Q: Can I use MicroPython with LVGL to drive the screen?**

A: No, it is not recommended. The Pico lacks sufficient memory for MicroPython + LVGL combination. The firmware may crash or fail to upload due to memory constraints.

**Q: Why does compilation fail with "PICO_SDK_PATH not found"?**

A: Ensure that:

* Pico SDK is properly installed
* The ``PICO_SDK_PATH`` environment variable is set
* Run ``source ~/.bashrc`` or restart your terminal

See :doc:`advanced_development/1.development_environment` for detailed setup instructions.

Flashing Issues
---------------------------

**Q: Why doesn't the RPI-RP2 disk appear when I connect the Pico?**

A: Check:

* Hold the BOOTSEL button while connecting USB
* Ensure the USB cable supports data transmission (not charge-only)
* Try a different USB port
* Try a different USB cable


**Q: The firmware flash fails, what should I do?**

A: Try:

* Re-enter flash mode (hold BOOTSEL and reconnect)
* Ensure the .uf2 file is not corrupted
* Redownload or recompile the firmware

Other Questions
---------------------------
